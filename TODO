- Send backtrace info to ABRT using BACKTRACE property.

- Acquire and send "executable" info (path+name):
    problem_data_add_text_editable(pd, "EXECUTABLE", "/usr/bin/sleep"); 
  This executable should be installed from some RPM, because ABRT
  ignores "unregistered" executables ATM.

- Added path to all *.class and/or *.jar(s) because ABRT needs to be able to
  localize classes and packages.
