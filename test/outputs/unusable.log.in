not-reportable
This problem is not reportable because of the low quality of stack trace. The stack trace contains lines having unknown source files and unknown classes. Such stack traces are usually produced by a non-official code. If this is your case, please contact the provider of the failing application. Otherwise contact the package maintainers directly via e-mail.
